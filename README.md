## Monopoly City Trading Unit

Have you lost your 'Trading Unit' from the board game Monopoloy City? Or it's stopped working? This is a quick alternative to the "build" button on that device. Visit https://antriver.github.io/monopoly-city-dice/

Press the Roll button and you'll get a random result of 1, 2, 3, or "Train".

This doesn't replace the auction button or the game timer. You can use a stopwatch for that.
